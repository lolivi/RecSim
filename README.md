# RecSim
Event Simulation and Vertex Reconstruction

## Simulation
- Two Silicon Detectors with Cylindrical Symmetry (z-axis) and R1 = 40 mm, R2 = 70 mm, Length = 270 mm
- Beam Pipe with Infinite Length and R = 30 mm
- Simulation of Particles with high momentum and straight trajectories

## Reconstruction
- Fast Reconstruction: smearing on hit point and simulated noise
- Vertex Reconstruction with X = Y = 0

## Instruction
- ".x FullCompile.C" to launch everything
- ".x OnlyCompile.C" to compile everything
- ".x SimCompile.C" to launch only the simulation
- ".x RecCompile.C" to launch only the reconstruction
